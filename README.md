ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Deniz!

# About Me
As a product manager turned software engineer, I bring a mix of business and technical skills, allowing me to bridge the gap between user needs and solutions. With a strong foundation in C/C++ and an endless curiosity for all things software, I am always eager to explore new technologies. My goal is to combine my technical skills with product knowledge to deliver impactful, user-centric solutions.
